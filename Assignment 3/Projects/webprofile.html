       <h2>About Me</h2>
       <p>I am a passionate student currently studying Information Technology at Humber College. With a deep interest in the tech field, my academic journey began with a strong foundation in computer science and programming, which has always fascinated me. Throughout my studies, I have developed a keen interest in cybersecurity, as I am eager to explore the various aspects of securing systems and protecting sensitive information. I enjoy learning new technologies and methodologies that can help mitigate security risks and improve overall IT infrastructure.</p>

       <p>Apart from my academic interests, I also enjoy personal growth and learning beyond the classroom. I am a firm believer in using technology to create meaningful change, and I aim to specialize in cybersecurity to contribute to the protection of digital assets and networks. Outside of my studies, I like to stay active through sports and exercise, which help me maintain a balanced lifestyle. My career goal is to become a skilled cybersecurity expert, working to protect organizations from cyber threats and challenges, while continuously evolving my skill set to stay ahead in the rapidly changing world of technology.</p>
